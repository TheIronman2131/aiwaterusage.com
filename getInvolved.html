    <h1>Get Involved</h1>
    <p><strong>AI Water Usage</strong> was born out of a school poster war and grew into a student-led effort to bring transparency to one of the most overlooked aspects of artificial intelligence: its environmental footprint.</p>

    <p>As the use of AI becomes more widespread, so too does the hidden cost of operating the massive data centers that power it. Cooling systems, particularly water-based cooling, consume enormous amounts of fresh water — and most people have no idea it's happening.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We aim to demystify how much water AI actually uses. This site was created to provide a real-time, research-backed snapshot of water consumption by major AI providers and cloud services. Our goal is not to scare people away from AI, but to encourage responsible development and usage through awareness.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Talk about it:</strong> Mention AI's water usage in your classes, clubs, or conversations. Most people haven’t heard about it — until you tell them.</li>
      <li><strong>Share the site:</strong> Post a QR code or link to <a href="https://aiwaterusage.com">aiwaterusage.com</a> on your social media, school bulletin boards, or even your laptop sticker.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> When using or building with AI, ask: how much energy and water does this use? What’s powering the backend?</li>
      <li><strong>Create your own project:</strong> Whether it’s a poster, a podcast episode, a school talk, or your own research, find a way to contribute to the conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaborate with us:</strong> We’re always open to new ideas. Want to help gather data? Design infographics? Build features? Reach out!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Small actions lead to big changes. If you’ve read this far, you’re already doing your part — and we appreciate you.</p>
